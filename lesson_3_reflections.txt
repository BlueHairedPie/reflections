When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
In case your computer crashes, you need to access it from somewhere else,
or you want someone else to be able to access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be some conflict, or it might break something that you are
currently working on. It will basically reset your work whenever it happens.
