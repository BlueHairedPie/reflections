When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
In case your computer crashes, you need to access it from somewhere else,
or you want someone else to be able to access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be some conflict, or it might break something that you are
currently working on. It will basically reset your work whenever it happens.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
A fork clones someone elses repository to my github, which is useful since I
do not have to create a new repository manually, and it links back to the
original. Clone copies a repository to my local machine, and branches are
named comits in a repository.
